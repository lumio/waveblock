Waveblock
=========

_**Work in progress!** First (dirty) prototype is more or less ready to play around with._

This is just a little test project. I was playing with some Web APIs to read the
frequencies of different audio sources and visualize them.

Currently the default source is the microphone. But soon you'll be able to load
a file to be visualized.
